## Project Description

The goal of our project was to analyse and visualize a real world datasets and identify potential correlations. The topic was chosen after collaborative research on available datasets, based on group interest and posibilities for analysis. We wanted to use data that can be applied to recent global developments of interest. 

## Questions & Hypotheses

With this project, we created a hypothesis that there is a correlation in the mental stability of a population, represented in the number of reported UFO sitings and global crisis. 

The project focuses on answering the following questions:

1) Is there a correlation between the number of UFO siting reports and global crisis?
2) Is there a correlation between the number of UFO sitings and certain search terms during the same period?
3) What does this tell us about the mental health of the US population during the Covid19 Pandemic?

## Dataset
We decided to collect and analyse data from two different sources. The datasets were collected via download as CSV files.

We used the following source for report data on UFO sitings:

1) http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html
The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database

For the data on search terms we used Google Trends:

2) https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=UFO

## Database



## Workflow

The workflow was outlined in Trello (link below in 'Links' section). The first step was to discuss the topic and achieve an agreement. Afterwards, we reflected individually about what we aimed for as personal development and what were our strengths and weaknesses. Then we individually researched the two data sources and explored the possibilities of analysis that the data offers. 



## Organization

We used Trello (link in 'Links' section) to organise our workflow as described in the previous section.

Our repository has:
 - directory containing all Jupyter Notebooks
 - directory containing all CSV files
